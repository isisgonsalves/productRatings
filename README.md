PROJECT TITLE: Product ratings
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This assignment requires me to maintain ratings for products sold by a company. Each product sold is stored in an array in ascending order. A rating for a product consists of the name of the person who rated the product and the number of stars that were given, in a range of 1 to 5. All the ratings for a product are stored in a linked list. My program reads product and rating data from a file and stores them in memory using an array for the product data and a separate linked list for the ratings of EACH product. A menu  allows the user to perform several operations on the data.
